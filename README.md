# Rennebu(gs)
Welcome to Rennebu and Bug report!

I hope you all enjoy the map
even though it has its shortcomings with lack of models, for now.

----

If you encounter a bug or something that can be changed for the better, please provide
- A good description of what I am supposed to look for
- A screenshot of WHERE (including the minimap with coordinates visible)
- If necessary, please draw arrows, circles etc. to help me narrow down what to fix.

----

"It happens here".

Even if the minimap is visible, I'm not able to figure out what "it" is.
Even if it's obvious in the screenshot, a clear description is the best.
To enhance my focus so I don't have to second guess and interpret the text, please also draw on the screenshot if necessary.
